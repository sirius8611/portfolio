          Hi! I am Hieu. Currently I am a sophomore pursuing a BS degree in Computer Science at VinUniversity. My interest is currently surrounding software engineer and AI, specifically recommender system.
          <br /> But beside all the professional titles, I am a whirlwind of innovation and charm, a mind for problem-solving and a heart for creative solutions. I always wish to make my mark on the world, one brilliant idea at a time.
          Hobby-wise, I love sports, especially basketball, as well as Jazz, Christopher Nolan movies, billiards. The list goes onâ€¦
